## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3.7
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## ðŸ”‘ Setup
Type the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ§© Download
You need **create** a directory `./logs/[YOUR-MODEL]` (e.g., `./logs/SEPC_derainL`). \
Download the pre-trained model and put it into `./logs/[YOUR-MODEL]`. \
Here we release the pre-trained model trained on [Rain100L](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html):
- [**Model**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bbEHVtVew6JCnwgktXJurJxibaPkQlNG/view?usp=sharing)

## ðŸš€ Quick Run
- You need **create** a directory `./testData` and put the degraded images to it.
- Test the model with the pre-trained weights:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py
```
- The test results will be saved to a directory here: `./results`.
